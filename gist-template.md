# Title (Matching a Hex Value:
` /^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/)`


 the hexadecimal is a number system that uses 16  letters a-f and numbers 0-9. One of the uses of hex system is the color codes for example #ff0000 is red in css and #0000ff is blue. 

## Summary
We'll examine a regular expression that can find any hexadecimal code within a string of characters.

A string of characters known as a regular expression, or regex, designates a text search pattern. The characters in question could be literal or meta characters. Meta characters, which stand in for a larger variety of characters, are frequently used to build regex.
the regex that we will breakdowm is:` /^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/)`

## Regex Components

### Anchors
in this code the anchors is the first symbol which is ^ and the second one is  $. So the ^ means that its the beginning of the line. the $ is in the end because it symbols the end of the line. for example ^44hhj4$
### Quantifiers
in this example they are using two types of quantifiers which are ? and {}.
the ? is a condition in this line meaning that the # dose not have to be there. the second one is {} which is the range of characters length. for example {4} meaning that it will be 4 characters long.
### Grouping Constructs
the group construct is () which groups the hole code with the or character
### Bracket Expressions
the bracjet expressions is [] 
### Character Classes
the character classes is boxed by the bracket expression which are a-f0-9 meaning that the letters that it will look for are a to f and the numbers it will look for ar 0 to 9
### The OR Operator

the or operator is | meaning it could be 6 or 3 character
